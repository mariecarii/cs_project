# CSCI 12700 Project

## Project Description 
For my project I decided to do something with dual purpose, a fun quiz game and also python review. I used the class notes I have collected through the summer semester to create questions.

## Languages Used 
Python

## How to Run
Open your IDE and run in console

## How to Use
This could be used to study for the class final or brush up on your Python skills.

## Future Plans 
I would like to continue building on this project by adding more intermediate/advanced questions and even possibly use it as a part of a larger project which would contain review quizzes for each language I learn (JavaScript, Java, C++, etc). 

## Project Inspo
I drew inspiration from this YouTube video I came across: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zehwgTB0vV8
